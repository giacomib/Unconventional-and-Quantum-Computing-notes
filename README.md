# Description
- There are for sure errors in this notes.
- I followed only some initial lessons, the rest of the material is based upon video lectures of the 2022/23 academic year, so there could be some discrepancies between what i studied and what is actually asked during the oral exam for the academic year 2023/24. 
- The specific course id is 2324-2-F1801Q165; this year the course was held by Professor Claudio Zandron and Professor Gabriele Gianini.
